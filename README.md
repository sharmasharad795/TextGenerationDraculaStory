# TextGenerationDraculaStory

1)LSTM has been used to generate a model which generates texts.
2)We have trained our model here on Bram Stoker's Dracula.
3)Three layers of LSTM have been used and run over 20-30 epochs.
4)Our models outputs 1000 characters.
5)We have used a softmax output layer for probability of character prediction and used one hot encoding for the output classification task
6)Scope for improvement includes running more epochs, using one hot encoding for input, removal of more non-alphabets.
